About 2 years ago, I got assigned to a project with an abysmal code base. It worked, but barely. Code duplication was rampant, libraries were old and outdated, implementation was strange to say the least. It took me a while to understand that it was actually a huge opportunity. At the same time, I had several juniors joining my team, and fixing that code base would be a great opportunity to show them what can happen.

In the first few sprints, my team removed about 60% code base.
